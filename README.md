# IAM-Cloud-Security
As part of the course, I tackled a hands-on project where I demonstrated my skills in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Here’s what I accomplished:

🔹 Created Two IAM Users:

Admin User: Full access across AWS services.
Restricted User: Access limited to S3.
🔹 Configured IAM Group:

Created a group with access to EC2.
Added both IAM users to this group.
🔹 Access Control Results:

Admin User: Retained full access to all AWS services, including EC2.
Restricted User: Originally had access only to S3 but gained access to EC2 upon being added to the group.
This project was a great exercise in understanding the nuances of IAM policies and permissions. I’m excited to leverage these skills in future cloud security roles. 💪🔐
